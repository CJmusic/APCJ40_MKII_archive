# APCJ40_MKII

A custom remote script for the APC40 MKII for Ableton Live 11. 

So far the only changes are: 

- nudge + copies a clip 
- nudge - deletes a clip 
- shift + nudge now nudges 

Changes to come: 

- Step Sequencer 

Bugs with Step Sequencer: 

- Crossfade buttons are always lit 
- Velocity slider doesn't work 
- Note repeat is always engaged (it's been disabled)
- Nudge isn't working 
- In NoteEditorComponent and APCNoteEditorComponent the tuple (x, y) isn't handled properly
